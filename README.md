# SimpleStorage Contract

The `SimpleStorage` contract is a basic Solidity contract that allows users to store and retrieve data on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functionality to store a favorite number, add people's names and favorite numbers to a list, and map names to favorite numbers.

## Getting Started

To get started with the `SimpleStorage` contract, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Solidity compiler: Make sure you have a Solidity compiler installed to compile the contract. You can use tools like [Solc](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html) or an online Solidity compiler like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

### Deployment

1. Compile the contract: Use a Solidity compiler to compile the `SimpleStorage.sol` file and generate the bytecode and ABI (Application Binary Interface).

2. Choose an Ethereum network: Decide which Ethereum network you want to deploy the contract to (e.g., local development network, Sepolia testnet, or the main Ethereum network).

3. Deploy the contract: Use a tool like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat to deploy the contract to the chosen Ethereum network. Make sure you have the necessary permissions and provide sufficient gas for the deployment.

## Usage

The `SimpleStorage` contract provides the following functions for interaction:

### `store(uint256 _favoriteNumber)`

This function allows a user to store their favorite number. It takes an unsigned integer `_favoriteNumber` as a parameter and assigns it to the `myFavoriteNumber` variable.

### `retrieve()`

This function retrieves the stored favorite number. It is a read-only function, meaning it doesn't modify the contract state. Calling this function returns the current value of `myFavoriteNumber`.

### `addPerson(string memory _name, uint256 _favoriteNumber)`

This function adds a person's name and favorite number to the contract's data structures. It takes a string `_name` and an unsigned integer `_favoriteNumber` as parameters. It creates a new `Person` struct with the provided name and favorite number, pushes it to the `listOfPeople` array, and maps the name to the favorite number in the `nameToFavoriteNumber` mapping.

## Examples

Here are a few examples demonstrating how to interact with the `SimpleStorage` contract using various Ethereum development tools.

### Solidity Compiler

You can use the Solidity compiler to compile the contract and generate the bytecode and ABI. Here's an example command:

```bash
solc SimpleStorage.sol --bin --abi --optimize -o ./build
```

### Remix

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is a popular online Solidity IDE. You can copy and paste the contract code into the Remix editor, compile it, and deploy it to an Ethereum network directly from the Remix interface.

### Truffle

[Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) is a development framework for Ethereum. Follow these steps to deploy the contract using Truffle:

1. Initialize a Truffle project:
```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
truffle init
```

2. Replace the default contract file `SimpleStorage.sol` with your own `SimpleStorage.sol` file.

3. Configure the network settings in `truffle-config.js` to connect to the desired Ethereum network.

4. Deploy the contract using Truffle:
```bash
truffle migrate
```

### Hardhat

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is another popular Ethereum development environment. Here's how you can deploy the contract using Hardhat:

1. Initialize a Hardhat project:
```bash


mkdir myproject
cd myproject
npx hardhat init
```

2. Replace the default contract file `SimpleStorage.sol` with your own `SimpleStorage.sol` file.

3. Configure the network settings in `hardhat.config.js` to connect to the desired Ethereum network.

4. Deploy the contract using Hardhat:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```
Replace `<network-name>` with the desired network name specified in the `hardhat.config.js` file.

## Testing

The `SimpleStorage` contract can be tested using various testing frameworks like Truffle, Hardhat, or Remix. Write test cases to verify the correctness and functionality of the contract, including edge cases and expected behaviors.

To run tests with Truffle, use the following command:
```bash
truffle test
```

To run tests with Hardhat, use the following command:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```
